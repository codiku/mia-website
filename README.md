# Getting started

Install packages

````shell
npm i
```

Start the local db

```shell
npm run db:start
````

Start the project

```shell
npm run dev
```

Display the db

```shell
npm run db:studio
```

## Toast and response

By default ky-config display alerts. Unless you send isToastDisabled:"false" in header request

## Routes Protection , and validations 100% TS support with Zod validation

### safeEndPoint

#### Strongly typed and zod protected API routes

Add public routes to `middleware.ts

Api routes :

Just wrap your handler with the `safeEndPoint()` hoc,

The signature is the following :

```javascript
export const PATCH = safeEndPoint(
  async (_req: NextRequest, route, body) => {
    const updatedProduct = await updateProduct({
      id: Number(route.params.id),
      ...body,
    });
    return NextResponse.json(updatedProduct);
  },
  true, // Is this end point public or private ?
  PatchProductModelUriParams, // URI Params zod model
  PatchProductModelBody // Body params zod model,
  // Query aprams params zod model
  // JWT Token (if private endpoint)
);
```

It Handles auth error and validations error

#### Strongly typed server actions

````javascript
export const updateProduct = safeAction(async ({ id, ...data }): Promise<Product> => {
  return db.product.update({
    where: { id },
    data,
  });
}, UpdateProductModelArgs);// Pass here the zod schema for the server action

It handles validations for body and query params with typing


It Handles auth error and validations error

## Session

To make sure you have access to the session, use withSession

## Crud

`npm run crud`

will create GET,POST,PATCH,DELETE, a prisma schema, a zod prisma schema.

## Swagger documentation

All Prisma and Zod models are automatically added to Swagger and can be used as JS Doc above the endpoint. Here is an example from `route.ts`:

```javascript
/**
 * @swagger
 * /api/product:
 *   get:
 *     description: Get all products
 *     responses:
 *       200:
 *         description: Returns a list of products
 *         content:
 *           application/json:
 *             schema:
 *               type: array
 *               items:
 *                 $ref: '#/components/schemas/ProductModel'
 *       400:
 *         description: Bad request if the product data is invalid
 */
export const GET = safeEndPoint(async (req: NextRequest) => {
  const product = await db.product.findMany({});
  return NextResponse.json(product || { error: true, message: "Not found" }, {
    status: StatusCodes.BAD_REQUEST,
  });
}, true);
````

In this example, the `Product` schema from Prisma and Zod is used in the Swagger documentation for the GET endpoint of the `/api/product` route. This provides a clear and accurate description of the data structure expected in the response.

## Storybook

Storybook is a tool for developing UI components in isolation. It makes building stunning UIs organized and efficient.

To run Storybook, use the following command:

```bash
npm run storybook
```

This command starts Storybook locally and outputs the address. Depending on your system configuration, it will automatically open the address in your default browser.

## End to end testing with Playwright

Playwright is a Node.js library to automate Chromium, Firefox, and WebKit with a single API. It enables cross-browser web automation that is ever-green, capable, reliable, and fast.

To run Playwright tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm run test:e2e
```

## Unit and Integration testing with testing-library

```bash
npm run test:unit
```

or

```bash
npm run test:integration
```
